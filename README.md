# Tail Recursion

In the lectures, we've seen code for a recursive implementation for computing
the Fibonacci numbers. Make this implementation tail-recursive. I have not
provided a template; depending on how you choose to implement the function, it
will have a different signature.

I have not provided any test code, but you can base yours on test code from
other exercises. Your tests must check the correctness of the result of running
the function and run automatically when you commit through a GitHub action.

Hint: It may help to have a look at the iterative dynamic programming
implementation. What changes between iterations of the loop?

## Runtime Analysis

Is the asymptotic complexity of tail-recursive Fibonacci different from the
non-tail-recursive version? Why, or why not, and what is the complexity
(worst-case $\Theta$)? Add your answer, including your reasoning, to this
markdown file.

The time complexity of the tail recursive version of the fibonacci number doesn't when compared to the iterative version implemented. This is because they both use the previous two elements in the array to get the next value which takes a constant worst case time complexity of $\Theta(n)$

The implementation was done by me with my knowledge of functional programming class I am taking.

The test file is copied from my previous repository to verify the results are as expected.
